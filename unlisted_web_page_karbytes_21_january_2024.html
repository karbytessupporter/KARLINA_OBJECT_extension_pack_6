Given that a human lifespan is typically (or historically) expected to have a duration of no more than approximately 100 years (with a positive or negative 20 year margin of error), it seems ethical (according to karbytes) that any criminal be incarcerated for no more than 21 years (per prison sentence and, perhaps in most cases, cumulatively across the incarcerated person's lifespan) (especially given the fact that it is possible and likely that any (if not most (if not all)) individual human organisms will reincarnate after its body dies at the end of its current human lifespan). I would not want to add more suffering to existence due to the fact that my "primary directive" ethic is to always strive to minimize the net suffering throughout all existence. Depriving a prisoner (no matter how "bad" the crimes were which that criminal was imprisoned for) of the opportunity to re-integrate into society (and integrating in a way which is minimally wasteful of human capital and minimally generative of suffering) seems unethical (according to karbytes). Otherwise, what karbytes argues is the case is that prisoners are made to suffer "unnecessarily" merely to gratify the retributive and sadistic cravings of people who want to make the prisoner suffer more than what karbytes thinks is ethical to inflict on any human person. According to karbytes, each unique individual person (whether human, artificial intelligence, or some other kind of "sufficiently intelligent" (and/or "sufficiently sentient") information processing agent), "deserves" to survive and to thrive to the maximum extent possible (i.e. with minimal impedance and minimal suffering) for the sake of enabling that particular localized allocation of cosmic intelligence (and the ubiquitous "field" of consciousness underlying all phenomena at all times) to derive intrinsic pleasure of knowing itself from its own particular "angle" into the larger all-encompassing "multiverse").
