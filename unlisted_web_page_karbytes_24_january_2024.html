If engaging in fantasy or delusion helps me achieve my goals more efficiently and with less suffering than would (presumably) be the case if I strived to make my worldview approximate objective reality as closely as possible, then I presume that I would be very likely to engage in elaborate imagination games even at the expense of being as impersonal, objective, and ontologically comprehensive as humanly possible.

I do believe that the general human public is too bogged down by grueling impoverished circumstances (with scant money and scant free time) to be able to effectively and consistently take requisite actions to permanently end human civilization's ecological dysfunction, dependence on offensive (rather than purely defensive) violence, and mandate that sentient non-human animals suffer on behalf of the humans which enslave, torture, and butcher them (but what is being done to help guide all humanity to "permanently better thought and behavior patterns" is the large scale implementation of surveillance drones and artificial intelligence assessing how material resources, money, and data are being distributed throughout the civilization such that regulatory functions are stealthily occurring to influence human individual decision making in a way which (ideally) maximizes each human individual's freedom and well being. What I am suggesting implicitly is that most humans have no major social obligations other than taking care of their own bodies and property and not infringing on other people's legal entitlement (and implicit obligation) to take care of their own bodies and property). Hence, what I would advise those people to do is whatever they want to because (I expect that) the big technocratic machine in the background will fine tune every human's thought, behavior, and perception in accordance with that machine (which I think is fairer, more consistent, and more science-based than outsourcing such policing to mere humans)).

Before I established my primary website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) in the year 2020, I used to believe that I would inevitably die from specific cells in my body wearing out and not being able to efficiently and accurately replicate themselves through mitosis and/or that my body would disintegrate along with all other forms of matter which I recognize if I stayed alive long enough to witness the anticipated "heat death" of my encompassing physical universe. During the first three to four years of that website's establishment and growth, I solidified my ontological and ethical convictions and decided that I now have the opportunity to extend by lifespan by several hundred years if not implement a method of keeping myself alive for an indefinitely long (i.e. potentially infinitely long) time period due to recent and exponentially accelerating advancements human civilization has been making in science and technology. I also thought that believing that such a feat is possible for me and others humans to undertake makes me significantly more likely to actually succeed at such an endeavor than if I assumed that I had literally no option but to die from age-related damage or decay. At the very least, the pragmatic implications for holding such optimistic futuristic beliefs is that it appears to help at least some people who hold such beliefs to feel more inspired to take care of their own bodies and also Planet Earth's environment. If I thought humanity was inevitably going to go extinct within the next one thousand years due to warfare and/or ecological collapse, I probably would not feel nearly as motivated as I currently due to mitigate my harmful ecological and social impact because I would think humanity and all of its hard-won knowledge and artifacts were literally being thrown into some kind of metaphorical incinerator to be irretrievably destroyed and then forever after unknown to anyone except for maybe God (if there is any such thing as God).

Well, to change the subject to a more practical subject than pontificating about mass extinction and covert technocratic surveillance and manipulation of human "volition", I would like to announce that, at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 24_JANUARY_2024, I intend for all the zip files which I enumerated in the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_usb_flashdrive_folder_hierarchy_24_january_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_usb_flashdrive_folder_hierarchy_24_january_2024</a> to be engraved on the last one of the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_6/main/mdisc_karbytes_17_january_2024_set_of_3_blank_disc.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set of three M_DISCs</a> which I ordered earlier this month and burned two of already (with the zip files enumerated in <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_17_january_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mdisc_karbytes_17_january_2024</a> before hanging each of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_6/main/karbytes2024p0_%26_karbytes2024p1_mdiscs_18jan2024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those two (labeled and bagged)</a> M_DISCs on the interior wall of my room). I intend to similarly label and package the third M_DISC after I burn it before the end of the day labeled 24_JANUARY_2024. 

(Rather than wait until later in the year 2024 to burn the files which are listed in karbytes_usb_flashdrive_folder_hierarchy_24_january_2024 to M_DISCs, I decided to burn those files to an M_DISC today because those files (especially <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT-main.zip</a>) relatively succinctly encapsulate the most essential content which comprises the body of public domain intellectual property referred to as karbytes according to the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABOUT_KARBYTES</a> on the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>).
