/** FOR_LOOP: Control is focused on updating the RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY section of karbytes' website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com in response to a karbytes undergoing what karbytes considers to be a "progress checkpoint" (with respect to karbytes' personal goals). */

For each instance in which karbytes updates a "micro directory" web page (e.g. the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_6 (which is referenced via hyperlink on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com))) which is referenced via hyperlink (whose visible text is highlighted black (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#000000") with text color green (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#00ff00")) on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com):

	/**  STEP_0: Control is focused on "raw" journal content. */

	STEP_0: "VERTICES": Update the source code and/or media file(s) which are intended by karbytes to be referenced via hyperlink (whose visible text is highlighted black (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#000000") with text color either green (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#00ff00") if the referenced file is a source code file (which is essential plain-text) or else the color orange (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#ff9000") if the referenced file is a media file.

	/** STEP_1: Control is focused on links to "raw" journal content on latest journal web page. */

	STEP_1: "EDGES": Ensure that each of those aforementioned source code and/or media files are accessible via hyperlink on the aforementioned "micro directory" web page (and that each of the hyperlink colors conform to the aforementioned color conventions and that the date component of the paragraph at the bottom of the "micro directory" web page (e.g. the paragraph text string "This web page was last updated on 19_JANUARY_2024. The content displayed on this web page is licensed as PUBLIC_DOMAIN intellectual property.") is the same day in which (a) any of those aforemenionted source code and/or media files were added to the respective GitHub repository most recently or (b) any of the hyperlinks to those respective files were added, removed, or edited in the respective "micro directory" web page).

	// (The terms "VERTICES" and "EDGES" in this pseudocode note pertain to the "metaphor" of a weighted graph (which is an abstract geometric type of data structure which karbytes thinks is useful for depicting the logical structure of its websites (i.e. the website name Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com))).

	/** STEP_2: Control is focused on social media posts and social media post logging. */

	STEP_2: If one of the aforementioned "VERTICE" files is a newly-added web page whose corresponding source code file is prefaced with the text string "unlisted_web_page", share the corresponding web page as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter profile web page, on karbytes' Minds profile web page, on karbytes' LinkedIn profile web page, and on karbytes' Patreon profile web page and then update the file in the respective GitHub repository named karbytes_social_media_posts.txt accordingly (e.g. the line of text "On 19_JANUARY_2024 at approximately 3:00PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes shared the following karbytes-created web page as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter dot Com page, on karbytes' Minds dot Com page, on karbytes' LinkedIn dot Com page, and on karbytes' Patreon dot Com page:" followed by one line of empty space followed by the line "https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_19_january_2024/").

	/** STEP_3: Control is focused on blogging website home page update time stamps and blogging website update logging. */

	STEP_3: After the aforementioned "VERTICES" and "EDGES" are determined by karbytes to be appropriate to label "as finalized as possible", update the "VERTICE" which is the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com by updating the time stamp (e.g. the string "<- (section updated on 11_NOVEMBER_2023 at 11:11PM Pacific Standard Time)") to the left of the hyperlink which references the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) to some arbitrary "point" in time which approximately represents when STEP_0, STEP_1, and STEP_2 occurred (and each of those three steps are assumed to have taken place within a period of time which is more than one minute and less than three hours) and then update the corresponding "EDGE" which is the source code file for that aforementioned home page named karbytes_for_life_blog.txt in the respective "micro directory" GitHub repository and in the summary GitHub repository named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.

	/** STEP_4: Control is focused on backing up the most recently updated "micro directory" repository content to volatile memory devices. */

	STEP_4: Download a zip file containing the most up to date versions of each of the files which are in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository and store that zip file on a USB flash drive and on karbytes' personal computer (which typically implements a Linux operating system).

	/** STEP_5: Control is focused on backing up the most recently updated "macro directory" web pages (including the blogging website's home page) to the WayBack Machine. */

	STEP: Save the most recently updated web pages of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com to the WayBack Machine (at the website named Archive dot Org) starting with the "deepest" node in that website's karbytes-intended web page hierarchy and ending with the "shallowest" node in that hierachy (which is the home page of that website) and in the order of "deep to shallow" web pages within that hierarchy.
