/** FOR_LOOP: Control is focused on primary and secondary website updates, update logging, and archiving. */

FOR_LOOP: For each instance in which karbytes updates a "micro directory" web page (e.g. the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_6 (which is referenced via hyperlink on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com))) which is referenced via hyperlink (whose visible text is highlighted black (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#000000") with text color green (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#00ff00")) on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com):

	/**  STEP_0: Control is focused on "raw" journal content. */

	STEP_0: "VERTICES": Update the source code and/or media file(s) which are intended by karbytes to be referenced via hyperlink (whose visible text is highlighted black (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#000000") with text color either green (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#00ff00") if the referenced file is a source code file (which is essential plain-text) or else the color orange (i.e. the color phenomenon generated by the hexidecimal color code "#ff9000") if the referenced file is a media file.

	/** STEP_1: Control is focused on links to "raw" journal content on latest journal web page. */

	STEP_1: "EDGES": Ensure that each of those aforementioned source code and/or media files are accessible via hyperlink on the aforementioned "micro directory" web page (and that each of the hyperlink colors conform to the aforementioned color conventions and that the date component of the paragraph at the bottom of the "micro directory" web page (e.g. the paragraph text string "This web page was last updated on 19_JANUARY_2024. The content displayed on this web page is licensed as PUBLIC_DOMAIN intellectual property.") is the same day in which (a) any of those aforemenionted source code and/or media files were added to the respective GitHub repository most recently or (b) any of the hyperlinks to those respective files were added, removed, or edited in the respective "micro directory" web page).

	// (The terms "VERTICES" and "EDGES" in this pseudocode note pertain to the "metaphor" of a weighted graph (and "weighted" according to number of times a particular "edge"'s components are collectively backed up to some kind of existing physical medium for storing digital files) (which is an abstract geometric type of data structure which karbytes thinks is useful for depicting the logical structure of its websites (i.e. the website name Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com))).

	/** STEP_2: Control is focused on primary website update and logging. */

	STEP_2: If one of the aforementioned "VERTICE" files is a newly-added or else recently-modified web page of karbytes' website named Karlina Obect dot WordPress dot Com, update the file in the respective GitHub repository named karlina_object_updates.txt accordingly (e.g. the string "On 22_DECEMBER_2023, karbytes added the web page named SIMULATION to the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com." followed by a line of empty space followed by the string "On 22_DECEMBER_2023, karbytes updated the home page of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.").

		STEP_2_0: ("VERTICE") Update the plain-text file named karlina_object_updates.txt in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository displays the date of the day in which the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com was most recently updated.

		STEP_2_1: ("VERTICE") Update the web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) such that the paragraph (e.g. the text string "karbytesâ€™ latest code and media files (following the (potential) finalization of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com on 24_DECEMBER_2023:") are available in the following public GitHub repositories:") which mentions that the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com may have been finalized by a specific date displays the date of the day in which the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com was most recently updated.

			STEP_2_1_0: ("VERTICE") Update the source code file (named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES.html) of the web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository and in the summary GitHub repository named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.

		STEP_2_2: ("VERTICE") Update the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com by updating the time stamp (e.g. the string "<- (section updated on 11_NOVEMBER_2023 at 11:11PM Pacific Standard Time)") to the left of the hyperlink which references the web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) to the time at which that web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES was most recently updated.

			STEP_2_2_0: ("VERTICE") Update the source code file (named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.html) of the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository and in the summary GitHub repository named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.

			STEP_2_2_1: ("VERTICE") Update the plain-text file named karbytes_for_life_blog.txt in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository accordingly (e.g. the text string "karbytes updated the web page name KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com at approximately 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_JANUARY_2024." followed by an empty line followed by the text string "karbytes updated the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com at approximately 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_JANUARY_2024.".)

	/** STEP_3: Control is focused on social media posts and social media post logging. */

	STEP_3: If one of the aforementioned "VERTICE" files is a newly-added web page whose corresponding source code file is prefaced with the text string "unlisted_web_page" or else is a newly added web page to the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, share the corresponding web page as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter profile web page, on karbytes' Minds profile web page, on karbytes' LinkedIn profile web page, and on karbytes' Patreon profile web page and then update the file in the respective GitHub repository named karbytes_social_media_posts.txt accordingly (e.g. the line of text "On 19_JANUARY_2024 at approximately 3:00PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes shared the following karbytes-created web page as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter dot Com page, on karbytes' Minds dot Com page, on karbytes' LinkedIn dot Com page, and on karbytes' Patreon dot Com page:" followed by one line of empty space followed by the line "https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_19_january_2024/").

	/** STEP_4: Control is focused on secondary website home page update time stamps and secondary website update logging. */

	STEP_4: After the aforementioned "VERTICES" and "EDGES" are determined by karbytes to be appropriate to label "as finalized as possible", update the "VERTICE" which is the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com by updating the time stamp (e.g. the string "<- (section updated on 11_NOVEMBER_2023 at 11:11PM Pacific Standard Time)") to the left of the hyperlink which references the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) to some arbitrary "point" in time which approximately represents when STEP_0, STEP_1, and STEP_2 occurred (and each of those three steps are assumed to have taken place within a period of time which is more than one minute and less than three hours) and then update the corresponding "EDGE" which is the source code file for that aforementioned home page named karbytes_for_life_blog_updates.txt in the respective "micro directory" GitHub repository and in the summary GitHub repository named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.

	/** STEP_5: Control is focused on backing up the most recently updated "micro directory" repository content to volatile memory devices. */

	STEP_5: Download a zip file containing the most up to date versions of each of the files which are in the aforementioned "micro directory" GitHub repository and store that zip file on a USB flash drive and on karbytes' personal computer (which typically implements a Linux operating system).

	/** STEP_6: Control is focused on backing up the most recently updated "macro directory" web pages (including the blogging website's home page) to the WayBack Machine. */

	STEP_6: Save the most recently updated web pages of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com to the WayBack Machine (at the website named Archive dot Org) starting with the "deepest" node in that website's karbytes-intended web page hierarchy and ending with the "shallowest" node in that hierachy (which is the home page of that website) and in the order of "deep to shallow" web pages within that hierarchy.

	// (First save the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_6, then save the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY, and then finally the web page named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (as WayBack Machine copies).

	/** STEP_7: Control is focused on primary and secondary website long-term (and non-volatile) archiving. */

	STEP_7: If karbytes decides that a sufficiently large "milestone" collection of digital files have recently been added or modified in the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and/or in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and have not yet been adequately backed up to M_DISC compact discs, burn collection of digital files to some natural number of M_DISCs, test those finalized discs to verify that they are computer-readable, and then store those discs in a relatively secure location. 

	// (karbytes typically burns files to M_DISCs no less than once per year and no more than once per month).

END FOR_LOOP.
