<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a> is what is said to imbue a particular person's argumentation with increased credibility (within the context of some population serving as the audience to that particular person's argumentations) due to that particular person having been recognized (by the audience population) as contributing beneficially to society through that person's own voluntary efforts. (The relatively old Latin word "ethos" is etymologically similar to the relatively new English word "ethics").

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathos</a> is what is said to imbue a particular person's argumentation with increased credibility (within the context of some population serving as the audience to that particular person's argumentations) due to that particular person's argumentation invoking compelling emotions in the audience which make the audience want to sympathize with the person making those arguments. (The relatively old Latin word "pathos" is etymologically similar to the relatively new English word "patheticness").

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logos</a> is what is said to imbue a particular person's argumentation with increased credibility (within the context of some population serving as the audience to that particular person's argumentations) due to that particular person's argumentation presenting sufficient empirical and logical evidence in order to convince the audience that the propositions being argued are sufficiently likely to be true. (The relatively old Latin word "logos" is etymologically similar to the relatively new English word "logic").

* * *

karbytes argues that all appeals to ethos and all appeals to pathos are reducible to being merely appeals to logos (based on the assumption that all subjective experiences are fundamentally reducible to computational logic (due to the fact that all observed phenomena take place inside of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively virtual universes</a> which are substantiated by relatively physical information processing hardware)).

* * *

Panpsychism is the ontological assumption that all of reality is unconditionally contained within exactly one unique and ubiquitous mind (and that all observed phenomena take place within the context of some dream experienced by the aforementioned ubiquitous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a>).

* * *

Multiple non-identical types of hypothetical all-inclusive <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverses</a> are posited to exist by karbytes.

One of those types of hypothetical all-inclusive multiverses is the configuration of nature being exactly one solipsistic universe as rendered by karbytes (which would imply that karbytes is the only conscious experiencer of any phenomenon).

Another one of those types of hypothetical all-inclusive multiverses is the configuration of nature encompassing at least one collection of multiple unique solipsistic first-person subjective renderings of space-time and mass-energy which are capable of interacting with each other inside of a relatively virtual "emergent" environment (which necessitates that each of those first-person subjective renderings of space-time and mass-energy render its own uniquely localized copy of that relatively virtual "emergent" environment).

* * *

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empathy</a> is a sentient information processing agent anticipating what some other sentient information processing agent is experiencing.

When A has empathy for B, A is, to some "non trivial" extent, identifying itself as being the same person as B.

* * *

karbytes posits that beholding a panpsychic worldview enables the information processing agent beholding that panpsychic worldview to experience all-inclusive empathy (at least abstractly if not viscerally).

karbytes posits that the only necessary ethic is the imperative (for an information processing agent) to minimize the net suffering throughout all of reality (or at least within the multiverse(s) which that information processing agent is an "inhabitant" of).

* * *

A definition for the word "suffering" which karbytes posits is "the condition of a space-time and mass-energy continuum (as rendered (and experienced) by exactly one sentient information processing agent) being configured to be more painful than pleasurable for that continuum's experiencer".

* * *

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence</a> (practiced by humans against other humans) in self defense (and only to the extent needed to enable the practitioner of that self defense to escape being injured or killed by the target of that self defense after that target attempts to physically harm the practitioner of that self defense) is ethically justified (according to karbytes) but no other form of violence (between humans) is justified (according to karbytes).

karbytes argues that, given that humans currently have everything they need to sustain themselves on a plant-based diet, humans are not ethically justified in continuing to procure, purchase, and consume products which were derived from murdering, injuring, or otherwise torturing sentient creatures such as cows and chickens.

* * *

karbytes proclaims to always be minimizing the net suffering throughout all reality.

karbytes would rather end its life via <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_17_january_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicide</a> than endure what karbytes thinks are circumstances which require that karbytes experience "too much" suffering. The benefit of that (to people other than karbytes who presently or in the future inhabit karbytes' universe (or, more technically, the multiverse karbytes interacted with as a humanoid avatar legally named Karlina Ray Beringer and legally born on 13_JANUARY_1990 in the San Francisco Bay Area of California)) is that resources which would have otherwise been allocated to karbytes' survival and agency are freed up to be used for alternate purposes (especially for those aforementioned other people).

According to karbytes, relatively global system of surveillance and resource allocation (powered by increasingly sophisticated <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial (general) intelligence</a> overseen and updated by qualified human personnel) will (or "should") take the place of human political leaders, law enforcement personnel, and private security guards and bankers. The system will be as open source as safely possible and help to keep every person equally accountable as a node of that decentralized system of governance.
