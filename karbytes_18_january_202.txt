1. Updated USB flash drive with most up to date karbytes content (prior to 18_JANUARY_2024).

2. Copied those files onto small Windows 10 laptop (because the disc burner does not seem to work for disc writing functions on larger Kbuntu laptop).

3. Burned the files which were copied from flash drive to Windows laptop onto two M_DISCs (and placed each finalized disc into its original container and then placed a hand-written label on the outside of the container (i.e. either displaying the message "KARBYTES 17_JANUARY_2024 disc 0 https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com" or else the message "KARBYTES 17_JANUARY_2024 disc 1 https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com") and then inside of a clear plastic page protector.

4. Tested each of the two M_DISCs using the Linux laptop and the USB disc drive which was used to burn those discs. (Test: delete original files on Linux desktop and then copy those deleted files from M_DISC to Linux desktop).

5. Placed discs (after returning to their aforementioned labeled packaging) in a storage bin inside of karbytes' room at legal residence (for no fee) or in a public storage unit (for approximately $60 per month).
